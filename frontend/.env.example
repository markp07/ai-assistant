# NOTE: Environment variables for the frontend are now managed in the root .env file
# Please use the .env.example file in the project root directory instead.
# This allows both backend and frontend to share a single configuration file.
#
# For standalone frontend development, you can still use this file locally:
# Copy this to .env.local and set your values

# API URL for the backend
# Default: http://localhost:7075
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:7075
